    <h3>Tea Cultivation</h3>
    <p>There are two types of leaf plants, the small-leaved plant with Chinese origin and the large-leafed Assam variety discovered on the border between Burma and India border. There is also a type that is used mostly in hybrids found in Cambodia.</p>

    <p>The best climate for growing tea is in misty, rainy regions at altitudes of 2,000 - 7,000 feet in the tropics and lower elevations in temperate regions. Dry days and cool nights produce the best tea. The best flavour is gotten when the tea grows slowly and under some stress but then the tea yields are lower. Tea bushes are usually cut up to one meter in height so they can be easily plucked. If tea bushes were left unattended they could grow into 12-meter trees.</p>

    <p>A white flower and fruit the size of hazelnut are produced in the bush. Usually, these are not allowed to develop because the leaves are what produces the tea. The oil in the leaves is what gives the tea the flavour.</p>

    <p>
      Tea requires to be maintained all year round. The tea plants are trimmed every 1-5 years. The tea plants are trimmed from wait to knee height in order to keep them from growing too much and to prevent them from developing branches that go sideways. Since the tea bushes are picked seasonally, that's how they are kept trimmed. Seasonal pickings keep the bushes trimmed like.</p>

    <p>The waist-high bushes at a typical tea plantation are often 25 to 90 years old. Tea growers are now experimenting with new strains such as TV29 that produce as many more quality leaves than present bushes.

    <h3>Tea Agriculture</h3>
    <p>Most tea is harvested on plantations that are called estates or gardens. These estates have ski-tow-like ropeways and chutes that are for carrying leaves to the processing facility. Sadly, the tea industry is a labour-intensive business that uses less fortunate people for plucking and drying tea leaves with a very little salary (less than 1 dollar per day). However, the workers usually live in free housing on the estate and they are given free medical care as well as education.</p>

    <p>Tea bushes can be grown from cutting or seeds. The bushes take about four years to mature. They are planted in the plantation when they are 6 - 18 months old, and when they grow more, they are planted into a permanent spot on the plantation, usually 4 feet apart. Approximately 3,000 tea bushes grow in a hectare of land.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Tea Harvesting</h3>
    <p>Tea leaves need to be picked carefully that's why tea is handpicked. Tea leaves can't be too big because then they are too tough, and if they are too small they aren't economically viable.</p>

    <p>The tea pickers pluck new and tender flush (two leaves and a bud). These flushes appear every seven or eight days in hot climates and around twice as long in colder climates. The buds near the end of a branch are considered to be the best quality. Lower quality one are found further down the branch. Good pickers pick around 160 pounds of leaves a day, form which about 40 pounds of finished tea is made.</p>
