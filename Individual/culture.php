    <h3>China's tea culture</h3>
    <p>The Chinese monitored the preparation and cultivation of tea. Only young women were the ones that were allowed to handle tea crops. The females had to follow rules like: not eating garlic, onions or any strong spices because their fingerprints could then contaminate the tea leaves.
    </p>

    <h5>The Invention of Black Tea</h5>
    <p>
      All Chinese tea was green tea until the mid-17th century. As the Chinese discovered a way to preserve tea leaves with a special fermentation process, a new type of tea was discovered, Black tea. The new Black tea persevered its flavour better and its aroma was more delicate than in Green teas, also it was better equipped for export to other countries.</p>

        <h3>Tibet's tea culture</h3>
        <p>
          By tradition, you can make Tibetian tea by boiling tea leaves for about 30 mins before passing the liquid through a strainer (traditionally made out of horsehair). Yak butter and salt can also be added to the tea and churned until incorporated. Younger Tibetians sometimes drink a variation of Indian Chai.</p>

        <h5>A Tibetan Staple</h5>
        <p>
          Tea remains a Tibetan staple, an average Tibetian consumes up to 40 cups or more per day. Tibetan etiquette says that no guest should go without tea and that the guest's cup can never be empty.</p>

    <h3>Japan's tea culture</h3>
    <p>The Japanese Tea Ceremony
      Under the influence of the Japanese philosophies of Zen Buddhism, a sacred tea ceremony called Chanoyu has evolved. The ceremony stresses the importance of respecting the act of making and drinking tea. The essential elements of Japanese philosophy are honoured during Chanoyu. Special tea rooms were built in backyard gardens because the ceremony was so important, a woman who could master the tea ceremony was allowed to marry.</p>


    <h5>Tea in Modern Day Japan</h5>
    <p>
      Today, tea has completely incorporated into Japanese culture. Tea is usually served with food and guests are greeted with tea too. You can find bottled tea in vending machines around cities and some shops sell Green tea flavoured ice cream.</p>

        <h3>Europe's tea culture</h3>
        <p>Tea as a Status Symbol
          Tea was accessible only to the wealthier population; the least expensive pound of tea cost the avergae labourer about a month's worth of pay. The high prices made tea elitist and highly fashionable. Wealthy English and Dutch families had paintings made of their families having tea. </p>

        <h5> The "Afternoon Tea"</h5>
        <p>
          The 7th Duchess of Bedford Anna is credited with creating Afternoon tea, which is still popular in Britain. The duchess complained of the long gap between light brekfast and a late evening meal; she ordered her maid to bring her tea and refreshments to her room and began to invite friends to join her, and that's how the trend spread.
        </p>

        <h5>The "High Tea"</h5>
        <p>
          High tea might sound more elite than Afternoon tea but it's actually the opposite. High tea was for the 19th-century working class; it was served around 6:00 PM and it consisted of a full dinner meal. High tea was served with meat, fish or eggs, cheese, bread and butter, and cake. High tea was seen as more of a masculine meal, unlike Afternoon tea.

    <h3>North America's tea culture</h3>
    <p>
      Iced tea was invented in the U.S. at the St. Louis World Trade Fair in 1904. Tea producers were serving regular hot tea, but one man poured ice cubes into his tea and soon enough customers lined up to try this new invention. Nowadays, the U.S. goes through 50 billion glasses of iced tea. in just a single year.</p>

    <p>
      Teabags were also developed in the United States. In 1908, a New York tea merchant sent his tea sealed in bags to restaurants and cafes. Later, he discovered, that the restaurants were brewing his tea directly in the silk bags they were delivered in to save time. This method immediately caught on. </p>
