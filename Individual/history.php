        <h3>Tea in Ancient China</h3>
        <p>The origin of tea can be traced back to ancient China. According to a legend, tea was discovered in 2732 B.C. when Emperor Shen Nung accidentally made the drink; leaves from a wild tree blew into his pot of boiling water. The aroma of the tea interested him instantly and he drank some. Legend says the Emperor felt a warm feeling as he drank the newfound drink.</p>


        <p>Emperor Shen Nung named the brew "ch'a", that's Chinese for check or to investigate. In 200 B.C., a Han Dynasty emperor made a rule which said that when referring to tea a special character must be used.</p>

        <h3>Tea in Acient Japan</h3>
        Tea was introduced to Japan in the early 9th century when the Japanese visited China and they taught them the traditions. A Buddhist monk Dengyo Daishi is credited for bringing tea seeds from China to Japan after completing his studies in China. Since then tea has become an essential part of the Japanese monastery life.

        Tea has integrated into Japanese society by 1300s; its religious importance has impacted the way the Japanese see tea and it directly influenced the Japanese Tea Ceremony. The Japanese have adjusted the tea to their taste, they engineered the tea to taste greener, more potent and not as sweet as Chinese tea.

        <h3>Tea in Europe</h3>
        <p>The Portuguese and Dutch were the first ones that introduced Europe to tea, in 1610. England's dance with tea, which is an English garden party which turns into a dance party, did not start until 1662 when King Charles II married Catherine of Braganza who was a Portuguese princess.</p>
        <p>Catherine had always loved tea and brought it with her. She began serving tea to her aristocratic friends at Court, and the exotic Royal beverage became popular quickly.</p>

        <h3>Tea in North America</h3>
        <p> Just like Europe, early North America followed European traditions and rules and was a tea-drinking continent. Teahouses, elegant silver and porcelain tea accessories were popular in cities like New York, Boston and Philadelphia. Teabags were also invented in the United States; a New York tea merchant sent samples of his product sealed in silk bags to restaurants and cafes throughout the city. After he discovered that restaurants were brewing his tea directly in the silk bags they were sent to save time, the method became popular.</p>
