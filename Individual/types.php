        <h3>Black tea</h3>
        <p class="card-text content">Black tea is allowed to wither, which leads to a process called oxidation. During oxidation, water evaporates out of the leaf and the leaf absorbs oxygen from the air. Black teas usually go through full oxidation which results in the characteristic dark brown and black tea leaves, typically stronger flavours of black teas. Black teas contain a higher caffeine content than other teas (50-65% of coffee, depending on the way the tea is brewed).</p>

        <h3>Dark tea</h3>
        <p class="card-text content">Dark tea is from Hunan and Sichuan provinces of China and is an aged tea that steeps up smooth with a natural sweet note. Dark teas are often compressed into shapes (most commonly cakes or bricks).</p>

        <h3>White tea</h3>
        <p class="card-text content">White tea is the most delicate of all teas. They are known for being subtle, complex and sweet. They are processed by hands using the youngest shoots of the tea plant and without oxidation. White teas can produce low amounts of caffeine when steeped at a low temperature for a short time. When steeped on higher temperatires and longer time, they will extract more caffeine; as white tea does not contain less caffeine than other teas by definition.</p>

        <h3>Green tea</h3>
        <p class="card-text content">Green tea is allowed to wither for a short time after being picked. The oxidation process is stopped quickly by rapidly heating the tea leaves. Therefore, when the tea is brewed at lower temperatures and for less time, green teas contain less caffeine (10-30% of coffee).</p>

        <h3>Oolong tea</h3>
        <p class="card-text content">Oolong tea is allowed to undergo partial oxidation. These teas have caffeine content between that of green teas and black teas. The flavour of oolong (also known as wulong) teas is typically not as strong as blacks or as subtle as greens but has intriguing tones. Oolongs teas are often compared to the taste and aroma of fresh flowers or fresh fruit.</p>

        <h3>Pu'er tea</h3>
        <p class="card-text content">There are two types of Puer: sheng puer and shu puer. Sheng puer is a simple non-oxidized tea whose finished product changes naturally over time. Shu puer starts as a sheng puer but goes through one more deliberate and accelerated process which uses post-fermentation to speed up this change into a matter of weeks instead of years. Puer tea is made using the Yunnan-grown Assamica leaf. </p>

        <h3>Yellow tea</h3>
        <p class="card-text content">Yellow tea that similar to green tea in appearance and flavour. Yellow tea, however, typically does not have the grassiness like some green teas. Yellow tea typically goes through more oxidation than green tea and it dries for a longer time. All yellow teas come from China.</p>
